# Test Tree Item Limits

This sample demonstrates that 52 collapsible tree items can be rendered within a single tree view, with 100,000 children under each item.

Although 5,200,000 total tree items are rendered for this sample, its possible that VS Code supports rendering even more. I've found that the extension stops functioning on my machine when rendering 10,000,000 items, but your mileage may vary.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View
